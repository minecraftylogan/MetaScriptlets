To show how absolutely dog-water I am at scripting, here is a shitty Meta-Data grabber for Scriptlet icons. Just unzip from the releases and place in your extensions folder. Open up Kual and select "Download MetaScriptlets"

Make sure you have airplane mode turned off and you are connected to a wifi network :D
An update-checker and all the rest of the cool stuff is underway! :)
If you want more icons or anything, please do pull requests!
* Current supported Scriptlets
*   KindleFetch
*   Alpine
*   Kterm

Changelog: 
* Version 0.0.10 is released!
